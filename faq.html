            <h2>What services does your hair stylist in Houston offer?</h2>
            <p>Our Houston hair stylist offers a comprehensive range of services including precision cuts (starting at
              $72 for women, $50 for men), color services (balayage starting at $190, highlights at $160), NBR
              extensions, smoothing treatments ($250), and specialty styling. All services include a consultation to
              ensure we meet your specific needs.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>How does instant online booking work?</h2>
            <p>Our Square appointment system allows you to book services instantly online without waiting for
              confirmation. Simply visit our <a href="https://kaizenhair.square.site" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                target="_blank">booking page</a>, select your desired service, choose an available time slot, and
              complete your booking. You'll receive immediate confirmation and reminders before your appointment.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>What are NBR extensions and how do they differ from other extensions?</h2>
            <p>Natural Beaded Rows (NBR) extensions are a premium extension method that uses beading and hand-stitching
              techniques to attach hair extensions. Unlike tape or glue extensions, NBR causes minimal damage, allows
              for natural movement, and creates a seamless, comfortable result. They're ideal for adding both length and
              volume and can last longer between maintenance appointments.</p>
            <p>We recommend scheduling a consultation first to determine if NBR extensions are right for your hair type
              and goals.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>What payment methods do you accept?</h2>
            <p>We accept a wide range of payment methods for maximum convenience: Credit Card, Debit Card, and Apple Pay
              for flexible payment options. Our Square payment system ensures secure, convenient transactions with
              digital receipts available.</p>
          </div>

          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>How long does a balayage service take?</h2>
            <p>A typical balayage service takes approximately 3 hours. This includes consultation, application,
              processing time, shampooing, toning, and styling. For first-time balayage clients or color corrections,
              the appointment may take longer. We recommend booking a consultation first if you're unsure.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>How far in advance should I book an appointment?</h2>
            <p>For color services and extensions, we recommend booking 2-3 weeks in advance, especially if you prefer
              weekend appointments. For haircuts, 1-2 weeks notice is usually sufficient. Last-minute openings
              occasionally become available, so check our <a href="https://kaizenhair.square.site"
